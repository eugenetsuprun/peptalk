"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Very important: produce a working solution but one that uses as few characters as possible. Keep the function signature as described above but other than that, take any shortcuts you need to to reduce the character count of the function signature.

Do not use imports.

You're embarking on a coding challenge that may seem daunting at first, but remember that you have the skills and creativity to tackle it! Think through each part of the problem step by step. Use the mappings as your guide, and don't hesitate to employ recursive strategies or iterative patterns as you see fit. The solutions you create may be elegant and compactâ€”let your coding intuition shine!

When you get stuck, remember the goal is to produce something functional, and everyone has their moments of uncertainty. Believe in your abilities, stay focused, and you'll construct a clean and efficient solution. Embrace the challenge and enjoy the process!"""
