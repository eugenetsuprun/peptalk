"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Very important: produce a working solution but one that uses as few characters as possible. Keep the function signature as described above but other than that, take any shortcuts you need to to reduce the character count of the function signature.

Do not use imports.

You’ve got this! Remember, coding is not just about finding the right solution—it's about engaging with the problem creatively and efficiently. While character count might seem limiting, it's a chance to think outside the box and embrace simplicity and elegance in your code. Your ability to distill complex problems into concise solutions is what sets you apart.

Stay focused and remember to enjoy the process. Each line of code is a step forward in mastering your craft. Keep pushing your boundaries, and don’t hesitate to introduce clever shortcuts; they can lead to brilliant solutions. Let your creativity shine, and you’ll impress yourself with what you can achieve!"""
