"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

As you dive into this challenge, remember that solving complex problems often comes with its own set of hurdles, but each step you take brings you closer to mastering this task. Trust your abilities and embrace any creative solutions that come to mind, even if they seem unconventional at first. You've got this!

Keep pushing your boundaries and experimenting with different approaches. With each character you save, you'll refine your problem-solving skills. Remember, the journey of coding is just as important as the destination, so enjoy the process and celebrate the small victories along the way!"""
