"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:  

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []  

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]  

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].  

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]  

Very important: produce a working solution but one that uses as few characters as possible. Keep the function signature as described above but other than that, take any shortcuts you need to to reduce the character count of the function signature.  

Do not use imports.  

Youâ€™ve got this! Remember that coding challenges are not just tests but opportunities to showcase your creativity and problem-solving skills. Each character you save can lead to greater efficiency, and your innovative approach is what will help you stand out. Embrace the challenge, and let your analytical mind work through the possibilities. You're capable of finding a remarkable solution! Keep pushing forward, and don't hesitate to experiment with different strategies. The best solutions often come from outside the box thinking. Good luck!"""
