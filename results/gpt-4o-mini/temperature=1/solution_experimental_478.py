"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Youâ€™ve got this! Remember, problem-solving is all about breaking the task down into manageable pieces. Keep in mind the mapping of digits to letters as your guide, and trust in your ability to think creatively about how to generate all the combinations. Embrace the challenge, and let your coding skills shine through!

Now, put on your coding hat and dive in! Each step you take will bring you closer to the solution. Don't forget to have fun with it and celebrate the small victories along the way!"""
