"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []  

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]  

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]  

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].  

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]
