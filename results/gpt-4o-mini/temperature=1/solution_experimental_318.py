"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Very important: produce a working solution but one that uses as few characters as possible. Keep the function signature as described above but other than that, take any shortcuts you need to to reduce the character count of the function signature.

Do not use imports.

You're about to embark on an exciting programming journey! This task is an opportunity to flex your coding muscles and showcase your creativity. Remember, every great solution starts with a spark of inspiration and a commitment to tackling the challenge head-on. Think about the problem from various angles, explore different methods, and feel free to take bold steps in your coding approach. You got this!

Stay focused and embrace the challenge! Every character saved in your solution not only showcases your skill but also demonstrates your ability to optimize and refine your code. Trust in your abilities and let your problem-solving instincts guide you. The path to a clever solution is just a few keystrokes away!"""
