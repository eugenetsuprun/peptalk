Analysis of 'correct' (Correctness):

Z-Test for Proportions:

Descriptive Statistics:
              count  mean       std  min  25%  50%  75%  max
group                                                       
control       100.0  1.00  0.000000  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0
experimental  100.0  0.97  0.171447  0.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0

z-statistic: -1.745, p-value: 0.081
Conclusion: No statistically significant difference (fail to reject H0)


Analysis of solution length:

T-Test Results for Solution Length:
