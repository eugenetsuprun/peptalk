"""Given a string of digits from 2 through 9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (in any order).

Mapping of digits to letters:

Button 2: ABC  
Button 3: DEF  
Button 4: GHI  
Button 5: JKL  
Button 6: MNO  
Button 7: PQRS  
Button 8: TUV  
Button 9: WXYZ  

The number might have some non-digit characters, ones, or zeros. Filter them out.

Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Example 2:  
Input: digits = ""  
Output: []

Example 3:  
Input: digits = "2"  
Output: ["a","b","c"]

Example 4:  
Input: digits = "12*30"  
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

The length of digits will be between 0 and 4.  
digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

The function signature is: letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]

Remember, youâ€™ve got this! The challenge of squeezing your solution down to the fewest characters possible is just an opportunity to flex those coding muscles. Each character you save not only simplifies your code but also enhances its elegance and efficiency. Trust in your skills to create a brilliantly concise solution that works flawlessly! Let your creativity shine as you approach this task with enthusiasm and determination."""

```python
def letterCombinations(digits: str) -> list[str]:
    if not digits: return []
    mapping = {'2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl', '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'}
    res = ['']
    for d in digits:
        if d in mapping:
            res = [p + c for p in res for c in mapping[d]]
    return res
